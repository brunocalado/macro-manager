# How To
You have to configure each macro manager. You do this in the module settings. 
- Go to this module settings. 
- Then, add to the Macro List field the names of the macros. If these macros are in your world leave the **Compendium List** field in blank. If these macros are in one or more compendiums add the labels of these compendiums to **Compendium List**, separate each one with **;**.
- The name of the macro MUST be igual to the name you put in these fields.
- After each macro name add **;**. 
- You can add ##MY HEADER## to organize your macros.

**Example for Macros in your World**
```
Macro List 01:
Macro Name 1; Macro Name 15; ##MY HEADER##; Weird Macro Name 11; Macro Name 3;
```

**Example for Macros in Compendiums**
```
Compendium List
My Compendium with Macros; Weird Module Macros;

Macro List 01:
Macro Name 1; Macro Name 15; Weird Macro Name 11; Macro Name 3;
```

## Macros
To trigger the dialog you can create a macro with the following code. You can switch between the macro manager `replacing the number 1 by 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 or 9`.

```js
const mm = game.modules.get('macro-manager')?.api.mm;
mm.openMacroManager( 1 );
```

You can call the summary with:
```js
const mm = game.modules.get('macro-manager')?.api.mm;
mm.showSummary();
```

### Custom Macro Manager
You can create a Macro Manager directly from code, without need to configure anything in settings.

**Example: World Macros**
```js
const mm = game.modules.get('macro-manager')?.api.mm;

const data = {
  "macroList": "Macro Manager 1; Macro Manager 2; Macro Manager 3",
  "title": "my title",
  "persistent": false
}

mm.openCustomMacroManager( data );
```

**Example: Compendium Macros**
```js
const macroList = "Macro Manager 1; Macro Manager 2;Patch All Actors (Savage Pathfinder); Macro Manager 3";
const compendiumList = "Macro Manager; Savage Pathfinder Macros";

// --------------------
const mm = game.modules.get('macro-manager')?.api.mm;

const data = {
  "macroList": macroList,
  "title": "my title",
  "persistent": false,
  "compendiumList" : compendiumList
}

mm.openCompendiumMacroManager( data );
```

## Keybindings
