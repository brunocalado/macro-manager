## Macros
To trigger the dialog you can create a macro with the following code. You can switch between the macro manager `replacing the number 1 by 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 or 9`.

```js
const mm = game.modules.get('macro-manager')?.api.mm;
mm.openMacroManager( 1 );
```

You can call the summary with:
```js
const mm = game.modules.get('macro-manager')?.api.mm;
mm.showSummary();
```

### Custom Macro Manager
You can create a Macro Manager directly from code, without need to configure anything in settings.

**Example**
```js
const mm = game.modules.get('macro-manager')?.api.mm;

const title = 'mytitle';
const macroList = "New Macro 1; New Macro 2; New Macro 3; New Macro 4";
const persistent = true; // default is false

mm.openCustomMacroManager( macroList, title );
```

## Keybindings
You can used keybindings to trigger too. 
Use **Shift+1, Shift+2, Shift+3, Shift+4, Shift+5 Shift+6, Shift+7, Shift+8, and Shift+9**.

You can trigger the Summary with **Shift+0**.

You can change these keybindings in **controls settings**.
